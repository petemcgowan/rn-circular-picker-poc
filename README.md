This is a POC of this fancy slider, which shows different values in quadrants.
https://github.com/florianguyonnet/react-native-circular-picker

I need to look into this further as I want to see if I can "animate" it. I reckon if the values of the sections are dynamic (in State), then this can be a result page, which is dependent on calculated values. However, it seems the names of the keys are set at compile time?

So I wanna look into either side-stepping this or figuring out if maybe I fork the CircularPicker origin file or just look at it.

I even have a fancier idea of it acting like a roulette wheel, slowing down as it gets closer to it's ultimate value (which would might actually be easier to do) but sections gotta be dynamic 1st. Tune in next time...
